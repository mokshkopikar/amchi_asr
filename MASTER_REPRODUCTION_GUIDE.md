# Amchi ASR: Master Reproduction Guide

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** January 3, 2026  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot (Agent)

This guide serves as the **single source of truth** for setting up, verifying, and running the Amchi ASR fine-tuning pipeline on a fresh environment (e.g., RunPod). It consolidates all knowledge gained during the setup and pilot phases.

---

## 1. System Requirements

### Hardware
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with at least 24GB VRAM (A10G, A40, A100 recommended).
- **Storage:** Persistent volume recommended (e.g., /workspace on RunPod).
- **RAM:** 32GB+ system RAM.

### Software Environment
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 recommended).
- **Python:** **3.11** (recommended and tested). Use upstream NVIDIA NeMo—do not use the AI4Bharat NeMo fork (it requires Python 3.9 and fails on 3.11).
- **CUDA:** 11.8 or 12.x (Compatible with PyTorch version).

---

## 2. Initial Setup (Fresh Instance)

### Step 1: Clone Repository
\`\`\`bash
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/moksh-kopikar/amchi_asr.git
cd amchi_asr
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Run Environment Setup
Use **Python 3.11** and **upstream** NeMo (not the AI4Bharat fork). The script installs system dependencies (ffmpeg, build-essential), PyTorch for CUDA 11.8, and NeMo. On Python 3.10+ it will install upstream `nemo_toolkit[all]`; you can force this with `USE_UPSTREAM_NEMO=1`.

\`\`\`bash
# Optional: use a venv (recommended)
python3.11 -m venv venv_py311
source venv_py311/bin/activate
# Then run setup (will use upstream NeMo on 3.11)
USE_UPSTREAM_NEMO=1 bash setup_env.sh
# Or without venv (script auto-detects Python 3.11 and uses upstream NeMo):
sudo bash setup_env.sh
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Setup Marathi/Konkani Model & Tokenizer
This script downloads the AI4Bharat model and extracts the **correct** language-specific tokenizer from the multilingual .nemo archive.

**For Marathi:**
\`\`\`bash
# Ensure you have logged in to Hugging Face (or set HF_TOKEN)
huggingface-cli login --token YOUR_TOKEN
python scripts/download_model_from_hf.py --repo ai4bharat/indicconformer_stt_mr_hybrid_ctc_rnnt_large --outdir models
# This puts the .nemo under models/indicconformer_stt_mr_hybrid_ctc_rnnt_large/ and extracts tokenizer to models/tokenizer/
\`\`\`

**For Konkani:**
\`\`\`bash
bash scripts/setup_konkani.sh
\`\`\`

## 3. Critical Technical Lessons & Architecture 🧠

### A. The Tokenizer Trap 🕵️‍♂️
The default tokenizer.model files provided on HuggingFace for AI4Bharat models are often generic or missing language-specific characters (like the Marathi/Konkani 'ळ').
- **Solution:** Always extract the tokenizer directly from the .nemo archive.
- **Method:** Inspect model_config.yaml inside the .nemo to find the hash of the language-specific tokenizer (e.g., def9dd6f... for Konkani) and extract it using tar.

### B. CTC-Only Fine-Tuning Strategy ⚖️
We use a **CTC-only** approach on top of the Hybrid (RNNT/CTC) IndicConformer model.
- **Rationale:** Avoids RNNT-specific joint/decoder validation and GPU JIT complexity (Numba issues) during training.
- **Implementation:** We instantiate the model as a Hybrid model but only train the CTC head. The scripts/fine_tune.py script handles the necessary config patches (e.g., setting aux_ctc.decoder.num_classes to match the local tokenizer).

### C. Data Loading & Filtering 📊
NeMo's default max_duration is often set to 16.7s or 20s. If your audio is longer, it will be silently filtered out.
- **Fix:** We set max_duration: 30.0 in our configs to ensure all samples are processed.

### D. Robust Inference 🧪
Loading fine-tuned checkpoints for inference requires specific handling because the checkpoint config may contain absolute paths or training-specific loss names that crash standard NeMo loaders.
- **Solution:** Use scripts/smoke_test_inference.py which patches the config in memory before instantiation.

### E. Research Logging & CER 📈
We have implemented a custom `SampleLoggerCallback` that provides per-epoch insights.
- **JSON Samples:** Saves `samples_epoch_XX.json` containing reference, hypothesis, WER, and **CER** (Character Error Rate).
- **CER Metric:** Crucial for Devanagari scripts where word-level errors (WER) can be misleadingly high due to small spelling variations.
- **Normalization:** The script now automatically strips Devanagari punctuation and normalizes whitespace before calculating WER/CER to ensure fair evaluation.
- **Visibility:** By default, it logs up to 40 samples to cover the entire validation set.

## 4. Marathi Pilot Results (January 4, 2026) 🏆

We conducted a 20-epoch pilot using the Marathi `indicconformer` model on the Story 4/5 dataset.

### Protocol
- **Training Set:** Story 1, 2, 3.
- **Dev Set:** Story 4 (used for validation during training). **Always use Story 4 for dev.**
- **Test Set:** Story 5 (used for final evaluation). **Always use Story 5 for test.** Do not swap Story 4 and Story 5.
- **Note:** This protocol ensures consistency with previous Konkani experiments. When re-downloading data or setting up from scratch, use `--use_story_split` so that Story 4 → dev and Story 5 → test (see `scripts/download_data_from_railway.py` and `data/README.md`).

### Performance
- **Final Test WER:** 0.351
- **Final Test CER:** 0.142
- **Epochs:** 20
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0001
- **Optimizer:** AdamW with Noam Annealing.

### Artifacts
Results are stored in `nemo_experiments/marathi_pilot_v3/`, including:
- `final_test_results.json`: Summary of final metrics.
- `samples_epoch_19.json`: Final epoch transcriptions.
- `epoch_metrics.csv`: Training curves.

**Note:** A full snapshot of the data configuration used for this run is available in [DATA_SNAPSHOT_AMCHI_KONKANI.md](DATA_SNAPSHOT_AMCHI_KONKANI.md).

## 5. Deaf Speech Training Guide 👂

Training for deaf speech requires different hyperparameters due to the high acoustic variance and typically smaller datasets.

### Recommended Settings
- **Epochs:** 50+ (Small datasets need more passes).
- **Batch Size:** 4 (Provides more gradient updates per epoch).
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4 (Stable for adaptation).
- **Normalization:** Ensure punctuation stripping is enabled in `fine_tune.py`.

### Data Protocol
- **Multi-User:** Always prefer combining data from multiple deaf speakers to help the model learn a generalized "deaf speech" acoustic profile.
- **Augmentation:** Speed and pitch perturbation are highly recommended for future runs.

*   **Trainer:**
    *   max_epochs: 20
    *   accumulate_grad_batches: 1
*   **Exp Manager:**
    *   save_top_k: 3 (Keeps best 3 models based on val_wer)
    *   create_tensorboard_logger: true

---

## 5. Verification & Training Commands

### Smoke Tests (Pipeline Validation)
- **One-sample smoke test:** Same single sample for train/dev/test, 5 epochs. Pass only if **validation loss** and **CER** both improve (decrease) over epochs. Run: `./scripts/run_smoke_test_one_sample.sh`. Output: `results/smoke_tests/`. See `results/smoke_tests/README.md` and `scripts/README_SMOKE.md`.
- **Full preflight suite:** `./scripts/run_all_preflight.sh` (includes a **GPU check** first, then library/data checks, then the one-sample smoke test as the final step). Always run this before long training to avoid running on CPU by mistake. See `LEARNINGS.md` for rationale.

### Preflight Check
Before a long run, verify the stack with a 1-epoch test:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/fine_tune.py --config configs/marathi_pilot_1epoch_test.yaml --output_dir nemo_experiments/marathi_pilot_1epoch_test
\`\`\`

### Full Pilot Training (20 Epochs)
\`\`\`bash
export APPLY_CONV_PATCH=1
python scripts/fine_tune.py --config configs/marathi_pilot_20epoch.yaml --output_dir nemo_experiments/marathi_pilot_20epoch
\`\`\`

## 6. Troubleshooting

*   **Hypothesis objects in logs:** If your samples.json contains raw Hypothesis strings, ensure you are using the latest scripts/fine_tune.py which includes the normalization patch.
*   **Loss is NaN:** Check your learning rate. We use 0.0001 for stability.
*   **GPU Visibility:** Ensure CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is set (usually 0). The preflight suite now runs a GPU check first (`scripts/check_gpu.py`); if no GPU is visible, it exits before running any training.
